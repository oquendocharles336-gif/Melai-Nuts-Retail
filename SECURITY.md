# Melai Nuts — Security setup & responsibilities

> This project uses **Firebase Auth** for identity, **Cloud Firestore** for
> account/role records (`users/{uid}`), and **Supabase Postgres** for customer
> business data (catalog, carts, orders, payments, refunds, loyalty,
> notifications). Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`) and Supabase Row
> Level Security (`supabase/migrations/…`) are the server-side gates; nothing in
> Dart is trusted.

## What is enforced where

| Concern | Enforced by | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Who you are | Firebase Auth | Firebase |
| Your role / branch / active flag | `users/{uid}` document, read **server-side** by rules | `firestore.rules` |
| Who can read/write each Firestore collection | Firestore Security Rules | `firestore.rules` (deploy it!) |
| Who can read/write each Supabase table / call each function | Postgres grants + RLS + `SECURITY DEFINER` functions | `supabase/schema.sql` then `supabase/migrations/*.sql` |
| Prices, totals, stock, points, refund amounts | Server-side SQL functions/triggers | `place_order`, `request_refund`, triggers |
| Screens shown for a role | `RouteGuard` (UX / defence-in-depth only) | `lib/app/route_guard.dart` |
| Rate limiting / brute force | Firebase Auth server-side throttling (+ App Check) | Firebase Console |

A modified app can bypass anything in Dart. It cannot bypass Firestore rules or Postgres grants/RLS.

## Must-do steps outside the Flutter project

1. **Deploy the rules** — `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`. Until you do,
   whatever rules are currently live in the console apply (the repo file is not
   automatically active). Run `firestore-tests/` against the emulator first
   (`cd firestore-tests && npm install && npm test`).
2. **Restrict every Firebase API key** (Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services →
   Credentials):
   - Android key: *Android apps* restriction (package `com.example.melai_nuts` →
     use your real package name + release **and** debug SHA-1s).
   - Web key: *HTTP referrers* restriction for your web domain(s).
   - Windows desktop uses the *web* app config and cannot be app-restricted —
     give it its **own** key restricted by **API** only (Identity Toolkit,
     Token Service, Firestore).
   - On every key use *API restrictions*: only the Firebase APIs you use.
3. **API keys are injected at build time, not committed.**
   `lib/firebase_options.dart` reads keys via `--dart-define`, and
   `android/app/google-services.json` is git-ignored. Local setup:
   ```
   cp env/firebase.example.json env/firebase.json                       # fill in keys
   cp android/app/google-services.json.example android/app/google-services.json
   flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env/firebase.json
   ```
   The Android key in `env/firebase.json` and in `google-services.json` **must be
   the same key** (otherwise `core/duplicate-app`). Use one dedicated key per
   platform (web, android, ios, macos, windows).
4. **Treat every previously committed key as exposed and rotate it.** The old
   keys are still in Git history and GitHub secret scanning flagged them.
   Rewriting history does not un-leak a key; restriction/rotation does:
   1. Create *new* keys (Google Cloud Console → Credentials → Create API key),
      restricted as in step 2.
   2. Put them in `env/firebase.json` / `google-services.json` and ship a build.
   3. Delete the old keys in Google Cloud Console.
   4. In GitHub → Security → Secret scanning, close each alert as *Revoked*.
   For CI, store the JSON as a repository secret and write it to
   `env/firebase.json` before `flutter build`.
5. **Enable Firebase App Check** (Play Integrity for Android, reCAPTCHA for web)
   and *enforce* it for Authentication and Cloud Firestore. This is the main
   defence against abuse from clones/scripts using the public API key. It needs
   the `firebase_app_check` package plus console setup — add it together.
6. **Auth settings** (Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings):
   turn on *email enumeration protection*; set a password policy at least as
   strong as the app's (8+ chars, upper, number, symbol); consider requiring
   email verification for customers. Review the authorized domains list.
7. **First Owner account**: create the Firebase Auth user, then create
   `users/{uid}` in the console with `role: "owner"`, `isActive: true`,
   `email`, `name`. Owners create all other staff/owner/delivery accounts in-app.
8. **Release signing / package id**: `android/app/build.gradle.kts` signs release
   with the *debug* key and uses `com.example.*`. Set a real applicationId and a
   release keystore (kept out of Git — `.gitignore` covers `*.jks`, `key.properties`).
   Build releases with `--obfuscate --split-debug-info=...`.

## Supabase (customer data) — setup and guarantees

**Run order** (Supabase SQL Editor, or `psql`): `supabase/schema.sql` →
`supabase/migrations/20260928000000_customer_security_hardening.sql` →
`supabase/tests/customer_rls_security_test.sql` (must end with 0 failed; it uses
a rolled-back transaction, but run it on a dev/staging project, not production).

**One-time dashboard/Firebase steps (cannot be done in SQL):**

1. Supabase → Authentication → Sign In / Providers → **Third-Party Auth → Firebase**
   → paste the Firebase **Project ID**. Supabase then verifies Firebase ID tokens.
2. **Give Firebase tokens the `authenticated` role.** Firebase tokens have no
   `role` claim, so without this every request is `anon` and checkout, cart
   sync, refunds and redemptions are refused. Upgrade Firebase Auth to Identity
   Platform, then `cd functions && npm install && cd .. && firebase deploy --only
   functions` (blocking functions in `functions/index.js`), then run
   `functions/backfill-role-claim.js` once for existing users. The claim is a
   *Postgres* role only — never put the app role (customer/staff/owner) in it.
3. Inject `SUPABASE_URL` and the **anon/publishable** key via
   `--dart-define-from-file=env/supabase.json`. The `service_role`/secret key
   must never appear in Flutter, `env/*.json` or Git.
4. Self-hosting only: add the restrictive issuer/audience RLS policy from
   Supabase's Firebase guide, because Firebase signs all projects with shared keys.

**What a customer can and cannot do (verified by the test suite):**

| A customer… | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| reads only their own profile/addresses/cart/orders/payments/refunds/loyalty/notifications | RLS `firebase_uid = token sub`, policies `TO authenticated` |
| cannot write orders, order lines, payments, refunds, carts, loyalty, redemptions, voucher usage | no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grant **and** no policy |
| cannot change prices, totals, stock, payment/refund status | totals/stock computed inside `place_order`; no write access to catalog/inventory |
| cannot choose a refund amount or line price | `request_refund()` recomputes from the order; client values are ignored |
| cannot farm loyalty points | points awarded only when an order is `completed`; cancel returns redeemed points/stock/voucher; refund claws points back |
| cannot inject notifications | `notify_customer()` is not executable by client roles; triggers only |
| cannot see product cost (COGS) | moved to `product_variant_costs`, RLS with no policy |
| cannot edit `rfid_card_number`, `email`, or `firebase_uid` on their profile | column-level UPDATE grant is name/phone/default branch only |
| cannot create a profile without a verified, matching email | RLS insert check on `email_verified` + `email` claims |
| cannot elevate their role | there is no role column in Supabase; app roles live in Firestore, writable only by owners |

New tables are **not** exposed by default (default privileges are revoked). When
you add one the app must read, `grant` it and add a policy explicitly.

**Not solved by the database — do these before real money moves:**

- **Payments.** There is no payment gateway. Every payment is created `pending`
  and only trusted server code may advance it. Online GCash/Maya/card needs a
  provider (e.g. PayMongo) with the **secret key in a Supabase Edge Function**,
  and a **signature-verified webhook** that marks `payments.status`. The app
  deliberately no longer collects card numbers.
- **Brute-force / abuse.** Voucher-code guessing via `sync_customer_cart` and
  order spam are not rate-limited by Postgres. Add rate limiting (Edge Function
  or API gateway) and Firebase App Check.
- **Staff/owner/delivery writes** to Supabase (confirming payments, moving order
  status, restocking, approving refunds) do not exist yet. Build them as
  `SECURITY DEFINER` functions that verify a staff role server-side, or as Edge
  Functions using the service role. Do not loosen the customer policies.
- **Reward fulfilment.** `redeem_reward()` deducts points and logs the
  redemption, but issues no voucher/redemption code for staff to honour.
- Leaked keys in Git history (see steps 3–4 above) still need rotation.

## Email verification (only real emails can register)

Registration is two steps: (1) create the Firebase account (no profile, no
access yet), (2) prove the email, then the customer profile is created.
**Enforcement is server-side:** `firestore.rules` refuses the customer profile
unless the caller's token has `email_verified == true`. A client cannot set that
flag, so a modified app cannot skip verification. Unverified accounts have no
profile and therefore no access to anything.

Two modes (`lib/core/services/email_verification_service.dart`):

| Mode | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| Link | `EMAIL_API_BASE_URL` not set (works today) | Firebase emails a verification link |
| Code | `--dart-define=EMAIL_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api/auth` | Your API emails a 6-digit code |

**Your API contract** (both calls send `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>`):

- `POST {base}/send-code`, body `{}` -> 200 sent, 429 rate-limited.
- `POST {base}/verify-code`, body `{"code":"123456"}` -> 200 correct, 400/401/403
  wrong/expired, 429 too many attempts.

**The API MUST:**
1. Verify the ID token with the Admin SDK (`verifyIdToken`) and take the **uid and
   email from the token, never from the request body** (otherwise anyone can make
   your API email arbitrary addresses).
2. On a correct code call `admin.auth().updateUser(uid, { emailVerified: true })`.
   Without this step the Firestore rule blocks every registration.
3. Store only a **hash** of the code; expire it in ~10 minutes; allow ~5 wrong
   attempts then invalidate; single use.
4. Rate-limit send-code per uid/email/IP (e.g. 1 per 60s, ~5 per hour) and
   verify-code per uid. Consider App Check on these endpoints.
5. Be HTTPS only (the app refuses non-HTTPS URLs outside debug builds).
6. Keep the Admin SDK key on the server only — never in Flutter.

**Housekeeping:** abandoned unverified accounts keep their email address tied up.
The app deletes them when the person taps "Use a different email", but run a
scheduled job that deletes Auth users with `emailVerified == false` and no
`users/{uid}` document older than ~24h. Existing customers who registered before
this change already have profiles and are unaffected.

## Known limits (cannot be fully fixed from the Flutter client)

- **Account creation by Owner** still creates the Auth user client-side. Moving it
  to a Cloud Function using the Admin SDK removes the need for any client to be
  able to create privileged Auth users.
- **Remote sign-out of other devices** and true account deletion need the Admin SDK.
  "Change password" ends other sessions.
- **2FA / biometric / PIN toggles** on the security screens are UI mock-ups; real
  MFA needs Firebase MFA (Identity Platform) or a `local_auth` flow.
- The Firestore offline cache is not encrypted at rest by Firestore. It is
  size-bounded and wiped at app start when no user is signed in.
- Order/price integrity is now enforced in Postgres (`place_order`, `request_refund`);
  the Firestore `orders`/`payments` rules from the prototype are no longer used by the app.
