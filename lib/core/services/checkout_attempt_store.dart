///  1. [begin] hands out ONE idempotency key per (customer, cart, request)
///     and saves it to disk. Every retry of the SAME request reuses the same
///     key, and the `place_order` database function returns the existing
///     order for a key it has already seen instead of creating another. The
///     server does not compare the request on a repeated key, so if the
///     customer changes their options after a request whose outcome is
///     unknown, [begin] first asks the server whether that request was
///     accepted (throwing [CheckoutAlreadyPlacedException] if so) and only
///     otherwise mints a new key.
///  2. [markSubmitted] is called right before the request is sent.
///  3. On success [clear] is called. On a definitive server rejection
///     [clear] is called too (nothing was created; a later attempt is new).
///     On a transient failure the attempt is KEPT — the outcome is unknown.
///  4. [resolveUnconfirmed] runs whenever customer data loads while online:
///     if a submitted attempt exists it asks the server whether an order with
///     that key exists. If yes, the order really was accepted (see
///     [recoveredOrder]); if not, nothing was placed and a retry with the
///     same key remains safe.
